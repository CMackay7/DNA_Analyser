These folders contain the agarose electrophoresis for plasmids that were irradiated
at Dalton Cumbrian Facility with protons.

Each folder contains an "about.txt" file, which specifies what each lane in the gel
corresponds to. The plasmid DNA was irradiated for 3 energies at multiple doses under various
conditions. Each folder contains many images of the same gel, at different exposures. For each
exposure there is also a "blank" image, to subtract from the gel image.
For each energy at each dose we have 3 repeats as well as "sham irradiations"
Sham irradiations undergo the full experiment but receive no dose, these are used as our 0Gy or controls.

The plasmid is usually under supercoiled conformation. A single strand break causes it to relax
into its open circular form. A double strand break causes the coiled plasmid to open up into
linear DNA.
Under electrophoresis these conformations form 3 distinct bands in the gel.
From left to right these bands are:
1) open circular (OC)
2) linear (L)
3) supercoiled (SC)
The proportion of signal between the 3 bands is used to calculate the types of DNA damage.


TYPICAL ANALYSIS
1) Subtract the blank image from the gel image (removes background signal)
2) Generate a line profile along a lane (should see 3 distinct peaks, occasionally the supercoiled
   peak may overlap with the open circular)
3) Remove background signal from the line profile (sample the gel image outside of the lanes to get an
   average background)
4) Normalise the signal so that the maximum peak is equal to 1 and get the signal values
   for OC, L, SC
5) Turn the normalised signal into a proportion of total signal, e.g.
   OC_Proportion = OC / (OC+L+SC)
   L_Proportion = L / (OC+L+SC)
   SC_Proportion = SC / (OC+L+SC)
6) Repeat the process for the 2 other repeats at this dose for this energy
7) Average the plasmid form proportions for the 3 repeats
